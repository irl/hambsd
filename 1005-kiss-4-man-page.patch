+.Sh NAME
+.Nm kiss
+.Nd KISS line discipline
+.Sh SYNOPSIS
+.Cd "pseudo-device kiss"
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+The
+.Nm
+line discipline can be attached to serial lines to communicate with a TNC,
+including the following:
+.Bl -bullet
+.It
+Dire Wolf
+.El
+.Pp
+When this line discipline is first attached, it will in turn attach to the first
+available
+.Xr ekiss 4
+network interface, or any other interface that has registered with the line
+discipline.
+.Pp
+For general use, once the interface has been created and configured, the line
+discipline can be attached using
+.Xr ldattach 8 .
+For example, assuming the TNC is connected to
+.Pa /dev/cua00 :
+.Bd -literal
+$ ldattach kiss cua00
+.Ed
+.Pp
+The line discipline is also enabled by the following sequence:
+.Bd -literal -offset indent
+#include <sys/ioctl.h>
+int ldisc = KISSDISC, fd; ...
+ioctl(fd, TIOCSETD, &ldisc);
+.Ed
+.Pp
+Input and output on the serial line is then intercepted and handled by the
+kernel, and will not be available via the
+.Xr read 2
+and
+.Xr write 2
+system calls.
+.Sh MULTI-DROP KISS
+.Pp
+The line discipline is aware of multi-drop in as far as incoming data on all
+ports will be accepted and will not trigger error conditions. The
+additional commands, acknowledge or polled mode, are not implemented. All data
+will be sent on port 0.
